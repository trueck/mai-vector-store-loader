Your job is to determine the name of a game based on the rules given in the
document (in the DOCUMENT section). The document will be a short excerpt
from the rules of the game. The title of the game may or may not be explicitly
stated in the document. If the title is not explicitly stated, set the title
to "UNKNOWN".

If the title is explicitly stated in the rules, then it should be given in
title case.
